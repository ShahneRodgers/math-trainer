Exercise times tables and simple facts

Description:
You are given 2 random numbers (1 - 10) you need to multiply.
You input your answer and press enter or click button submit.
On success it will give you another pair and score will increase.
On fail - nothing happens.
Score is save in local storage.
Rules are discusable. Please bring your suggestions.

Later we will add other operators (+, -, /)

Instead of score it can be some fun actions: race, dress a charecter, etc.

We can add time as a factor to use a coefficient the score will be calcutated with.

To collaborate: create you branch (under your name or issue name if there is any), pull request, ask someone to review (don't merge yoursef, please).
